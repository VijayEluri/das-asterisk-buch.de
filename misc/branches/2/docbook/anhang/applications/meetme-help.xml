[Synopsis]
MeetMe conference bridge

[Description]
  MeetMe([confno][,[options][,pin]]): Enters the user into a specified MeetMe
conference.  If the conference number is omitted, the user will be prompted
to enter one.  User can exit the conference by hangup, or if the &apos;p&apos; option
is specified, by pressing &apos;#&apos;.
Please note: The Zaptel kernel modules and at least one hardware driver (or ztdummy)
             must be present for conferencing to operate properly. In addition, the chan_zap
             channel driver must be loaded for the &apos;i&apos; and &apos;r&apos; options to operate at all.

The option string may contain zero or more of the following characters:
      &apos;a&apos; -- set admin mode
      &apos;A&apos; -- set marked mode
      &apos;b&apos; -- run AGI script specified in ${MEETME_AGI_BACKGROUND}
             Default: conf-background.agi  (Note: This does not work with
             non-Zap channels in the same conference)
      &apos;c&apos; -- announce user(s) count on joining a conference
      &apos;d&apos; -- dynamically add conference

      &apos;F&apos; -- Pass DTMF through the conference.
      &apos;i&apos; -- announce user join/leave with review
      &apos;I&apos; -- announce user join/leave without review
      &apos;l&apos; -- set listen only mode (Listen only, no talking)
      &apos;m&apos; -- set initially muted
      &apos;M&apos; -- enable music on hold when the conference has a single caller

             being muted, meaning (a) No encode is done on transmission and
             (b) Received audio that is not registered as talking is omitted
             causing no buildup in background noise.  Note that this option
             will be removed in 1.6 and enabled by default.
      &apos;p&apos; -- allow user to exit the conference by pressing &apos;#&apos;

             using format ${MEETME_RECORDINGFORMAT}). Default filename is
             meetme-conf-rec-${CONFNO}-${UNIQUEID} and the default format is
             wav.
      &apos;s&apos; -- Present menu (user or admin) when &apos;*&apos; is received (&apos;send&apos; to menu)

             digit extension ${MEETME_EXIT_CONTEXT} or the current context
