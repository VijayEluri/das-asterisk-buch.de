 Usage: RECEIVE CHAR <timeout>
        Receives a character of text on a channel. Specify timeout to be the
 maximum time to wait for input in milliseconds, or 0 for infinite. Most channels
 do not support the reception of text. Returns the decimal value of the character
 if one is received, or 0 if the channel does not support text reception.  Returns
 -1 only on error/hangup.
