[Synopsis]
Require phone number to be entered, if no CallerID sent

[Description]
  PrivacyManager([maxretries[|minlength[|options]]]): If no Caller*ID
is sent, PrivacyManager answers the channel and asks the caller to
enter their phone number. The caller is given 3 attempts to do so.
The application does nothing if Caller*ID was received on the channel.
  Configuration file privacy.conf contains two variables:
   maxretries  default 3  -maximum number of attempts the caller is allowed
               to input a callerid.
   minlength   default 10 -minimum allowable digits in the input callerid number.
If you don't want to use the config file and have an i/o operation with
every call, you can also specify maxretries and minlength as application
parameters. Doing so supercedes any values set in privacy.conf.
The option string may contain the following character:
  'j' -- jump to n+101 priority after <maxretries> failed attempts to collect
         the minlength number of digits.
The application sets the following channel variable upon completion:
PRIVACYMGRSTATUS  The status of the privacy manager's attempt to collect
                  a phone number from the user. A text string that is either:
          SUCCESS | FAILED
