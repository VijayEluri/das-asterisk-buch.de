[Synopsis]
Evaluates a string

[Description]
Usage: Eval(newvar=somestring)
  Normally Asterisk evaluates variables inline.  But what if you want to
store variable offsets in a database, to be evaluated later?  Eval is
the answer, by allowing a string to be evaluated twice in the dialplan,
the first time as part of the normal dialplan, and the second using Eval.
