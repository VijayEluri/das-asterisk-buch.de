[Synopsis]
Set channel variable or function value

[Description]
  Set(name=value)
This function can be used to set the value of channel variables or dialplan
functions. When setting variables, if the variable name is prefixed with _,
the variable will be inherited into channels created from the current
channel. If the variable name is prefixed with __, the variable will be
inherited into channels created from the current channel and all children
channels.
Compatibility note: If (and only if), in /etc/asterisk/asterisk.conf, you have a [compat]
category, and you have app_set = 1.6 under that, then the behavior of this
app changes, and does not strip surrounding quotes from the right hand side
as it did previously in 1.4. The app_set = 1.6 is only inserted if 'make samples'
is executed, or if users insert this by hand into the asterisk.conf file.
/nThe advantages of not stripping out quoting, and not caring about the
separator characters (comma and vertical bar) were sufficient to make these
changes in 1.6. Confusion about how many backslashes would be needed to properly
protect separators and quotes in various database access strings has been greatly
reduced by these changes.
