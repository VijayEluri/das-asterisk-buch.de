  <title>Foreword</title>

  <para>Dear Reader,</para>

  <para>you are reading the English version of my second Asterisk book. I
  wrote the book in German and Stephen Bosch translated it into English. He
  (being an Asterisk professional) also added some North-America specifics.
  But this book is a project of many people. Ever since the first version it
  has been published with a FDL licence and more than 100 people contributed
  by sending bugreports or even by writing new sections. A special thanks goes
  to my colleage Philipp Kempgen who wrote big chunks for this book. You can
  find the German edition as per usual at <ulink
  url="http://das-asterisk-buch.de">das-asterisk-buch.de</ulink> and
  the English version at <ulink
  url="http://www.the-asterisk-book.com">www.the-asterisk-book.com</ulink>.
  Especialy for hardware and driver related stuff (e.g. installing a card and
  compiling Asterisk for it) I encourage you to have a look at the always up
  to date online edition.</para>

  <para>The last few years have been active ones in the VoIP world. My work
  with Asterisk has brought me to parts of the world where I haven't been
  before: Huntsville, Alabama (Digium's headquarter), Toronto, Canada
  (Sangoma's headquarter) and Bucharest, Romania (Yate's headquarter). I
  learned much about Asterisk, but also a lot about <ulink
  url="http://yate.null.ro/">Yate</ulink> and <ulink
  url="http://www.freeswitch.org/">FreeSwitch</ulink>, both interesting
  open-source VoIP alternatives.</para>

  <para>Asterisk has gone quite a way since I installed it first. That very
  first installation didn't last long on my harddrive because I didn't
  understand the whole concept of it and documentation was in a good
  open-source manner (read the source code). But my first linux installation
  didn't last long on my harddrive either because my MS-DOS way of searching
  files (entering "dir" and ENTER) did not give any results at all. Today I
  don't want to miss either of these open-source projects. Linux changed
  everything for me (I haven't touched a Windows since version 3.11). Asterisk
  changed my way of thinking about PBXes. Finally a PBX was just a piece of
  software and not some magic black box on the wall.</para>

  <para>But the jump from the old world (black box PBX) to the new world (just
  software) is one that is critical in many companies. In my daily work as an
  Asterisk consultant I often see a fight between the former network guys and
  the former telephony guys which have been seperated for decades and now have
  to work as a team. I hope to bring both worlds a little bit more together
  with this book.</para>

  <para>I welcome your feedback, praise and criticism. Please send it to me at
  <email>stefan.wintermeyer@amooma.de</email>.</para>

  <para>Dear Reader,</para>

  <para>It has been a special privilege to work with Stefan on the translation
  of this book into English. As it happens, Stefan speaks English quite well;
  being the consummate professional that he is, he knew that a competent
  English version would need a dedicated translator. To be entrusted with this
  task has been an honor. I was also charged with some of the adaptations and
  changes for the English edition, including for the chapter on ISDN and for
  the hardware installation chapter.</para>

  <para>Translations are never easy endeavors, but like poetry, a technical
  translation is a special kind of beast. I hope that the book you have in
  your hands proves readable and helpful. Like Stefan, I welcome your
  feedback. Please send it to me at <email>sbosch@vodacomm.ca</email>.</para>
