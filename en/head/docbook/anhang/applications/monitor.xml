    <synopsis><command>Monitor([<replaceable>format</replaceable>[,<replaceable>fileprefix</replaceable>[,<replaceable>options</replaceable>]]])</command></synopsis>

    <simpara>Starts audio recording on the current channel. Incoming and
    outgoing audio packets are written to separate files until the channel is
    hung up or monitoring is stopped with
    <code><command>StopMonitor()</command></code>.</simpara>

    <simpara>The parameter <replaceable>format</replaceable> sets the file
    format. If this is not specified, <code>wav</code> is used.</simpara>

    <simpara>The parameter <replaceable>fileprefix</replaceable> specifies the
    filename without extension. If this is not specified, the filename is
    assembled out of the channel name and a number, for example,<code>
    IAX2[foo@bar]-3</code>. Incoming audio is written to
    <filename><replaceable>fileprefix</replaceable>-in.<replaceable>format</replaceable></filename>,
    outgoing audio in
    <filename><replaceable>fileprefix</replaceable>-out.<replaceable>format</replaceable></filename>,
    both in <filename>/var/spool/asterisk/monitor/</filename>.</simpara>

            Requires that <command>soxmix</command> from the

              </footnote>If the variable <code>${MONITOR_EXEC}</code> is
            defined, this application is executed instead of
            <command>soxmix</command> and the original incoming and outgoing
            audio files are not deleted.<footnote>
                <para>depends on Asterisk version; older versions do not
                delete automatically. It's best to check with a proper
                test.</para>
              </footnote>. <command>soxmix</command> (or
            <command>${MONITOR_EXEC}</command> if specified) is passed three
            values: the names of the incoming and outgoing audio files and the
            name of the mixed file, which is the fileprefix without
            <code>-in</code>/<code>-out</code>. If
            <code>${MONITOR_EXEC_ARGS}</code> is set, the contents are used as
            arguments to <code>${MONITOR_EXEC}</code>.</simpara>

            <important>
              <para>Note that <command>soxmix</command> attempts to determine
              the file type based on the file extension. Formats such as
              <code>gsm</code> and <code>wav</code> are normally not a
              problem, but for other formats such as <code>alaw</code> and
              <code>ulaw</code>, it expects the file extensions
              <code>.al</code> and <code>.ul</code> respectively. To resolve
              this, read the manual pages for sox (/soxmix) and use
              <code>${MONITOR_EXEC_ARGS}</code> or write a small wrapper
              script that reads the format parameter and call it in
              <code>${MONITOR_EXEC}</code>.</para>
            </important>

            <note>
              <simpara>If you wanted a single mixed sound file,
              <code>MixMonitor()</code> is usually the better option, as it
              mixes on-the-fly and thereby avoids a spike in CPU load at the
              end of the recording.</simpara>

      <para>Before recording conversations, make sure you are complying with
      the relevant legislation in your jurisdiction. In most cases, both

    <note>
      <simpara>Some Asterisk users who routinely need to record many
      conversations (50-500) report much better performance if call recordings
      are written to a RAM disk (fewer and shorter seek operations) before
      being copied to a hard disk when the conversation is over.</simpara>

[Synopsis]
Monitor a channel

[Description]
Monitor([file_format[:urlbase]|[fname_base]|[options]]):
Used to start monitoring a channel. The channel's input and output
voice packets are logged to files until the channel hangs up or
monitoring is stopped by the StopMonitor application.
  file_format  optional, if not set, defaults to "wav"
  fname_base   if set, changes the filename used to the one specified.
  options:
    m   - when the recording ends mix the two leg files into one and
          delete the two leg files.  If the variable MONITOR_EXEC is set, the
          application referenced in it will be executed instead of
          soxmix and the raw leg files will NOT be deleted automatically.
          soxmix or MONITOR_EXEC is handed 3 arguments, the two leg files
          and a target mixed file name which is the same as the leg file names
          only without the in/out designator.
          If MONITOR_EXEC_ARGS is set, the contents will be passed on as
          additional arguements to MONITOR_EXEC
          Both MONITOR_EXEC and the Mix flag can be set from the
          administrator interface

    b   - Don't begin recording unless a call is bridged to another channel

Returns -1 if monitor files can't be opened or if the channel is already
monitored, otherwise 0.</screen></para>
