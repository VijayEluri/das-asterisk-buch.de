[Synopsis]
Park yourself

[Description]
Park():Used to park yourself (typically in combination with a supervised
transfer to know the parking space). This application is always
registered internally and does not need to be explicitly added
into the dialplan, although you should include the 'parkedcalls'
context (or the context specified in features.conf).

If you set the PARKINGEXTEN variable to an extension in your
parking context, park() will park the call on that extension, unless
it already exists. In that case, execution will continue at next
priority.</screen></para>
