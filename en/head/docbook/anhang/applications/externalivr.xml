Interfaces with an external IVR application

[Description]
  ExternalIVR(command[|arg[|arg...]]): Forks an process to run the supplied command,
and starts a generator on the channel. The generator's play list is
controlled by the external application, which can add and clear entries
via simple commands issued over its stdout. The external application
will receive all DTMF events received on the channel, and notification
if the channel is hung up. The application will not be forcibly terminated
when the channel is hung up.
