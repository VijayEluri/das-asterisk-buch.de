    <tip>
      <para>Most devices treat a page like any other call. If the device is
      not explicitly instructed to auto-answer, it will simply ring, and the
      intended recipient will not hear the message. SIP devices can be told to
      auto-answer, often by setting a SIP header. Every device is different;
      review the administration manuals for your SIP phone.</para>
