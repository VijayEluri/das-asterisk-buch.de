    the device is not a member in it, or if no queue is specified and the
    device does not belong to any queues <emphasis>and</emphasis> option

    <simpara>Returns 0 on success, otherwise returns -1 if the interface
    cannot be found or the jump priority does not exist. Sets the channel
    variable <code>PQMSTATUS</code> to <code>PAUSED</code> or
    <code>NOTFOUND</code>.</simpara>

    <programlisting>; If we dial *111002, Agent/1002 is paused on all queues where she is a member:
exten =&gt; *11ZXXX,1,PauseQueueMember(,Agent/${EXTEN:3})

; Dialing *121002 unpauses Agent/1002 again:
exten =&gt; *12ZXXX,1,UnpauseQueueMember(,Agent/${EXTEN:3})</programlisting>

[Synopsis]
Pauses a queue member

[Description]
   PauseQueueMember([queuename]|interface[|options]):
Pauses (blocks calls for) a queue member.
The given interface will be paused in the given queue.  This prevents
any calls from being sent from the queue to the interface until it is
unpaused with UnpauseQueueMember or the manager interface.  If no
queuename is given, the interface is paused in every queue it is a
member of.  If the interface is not in the named queue, or if no queue
is given and the interface is not in any queue, it will jump to
priority n+101, if it exists and the appropriate options are set.
The application will fail if the interface is not found and no extension
to jump to exists.
The option string may contain zero or more of the following characters:
       'j' -- jump to +101 priority when appropriate.
  This application sets the following channel variable upon completion:
     PQMSTATUS      The status of the attempt to pause a queue member as a
                     text string, one of
           PAUSED | NOTFOUND
Example: PauseQueueMember(|SIP/3000)</screen></para>
