    <simpara>Parks the current call in the parking lot, but announces the
    parking space on another, specified channel. The
    <code><replaceable>template</replaceable></code> specifies a
    colon-delimited list of sound files to be played; the word
    <code>PARKED</code> in the example below is replaced with the parking
    space number assigned to the parked call. The
    <code><replaceable>timeout</replaceable></code> sets the maximum time the
    call may be parked before it is placed back in the
    <code><replaceable>return-context</replaceable></code>. The
    <code><replaceable>channel</replaceable></code> denotes the channel on
    which the announcement is to be made (in our example,
    <code>Console/dsp</code> prints the announcements to the Asterisk
    console). The <code><replaceable>return-context</replaceable></code> is a
    label in <code><command>GoTo()</command></code> format that determines the
    context to return the call to if it is not retrieved from the parking lot
    by a user within the defined <replaceable>timeout</replaceable> window.
    The default return priority is <replaceable>n</replaceable>+1 in
    <code><replaceable>return-context</replaceable></code>.</simpara>

[Synopsis]
Park and Announce

[Description]
  ParkAndAnnounce(announce:template|timeout|dial|[return_context]):
Park a call into the parkinglot and announce the call to another channel.

announce template: Colon-separated list of files to announce.  The word PARKED
                   will be replaced by a say_digits of the extension in which
                   the call is parked.
timeout:           Time in seconds before the call returns into the return
                   context.
dial:              The app_dial style resource to call to make the
                   announcement.  Console/dsp calls the console.
return_context:    The goto-style label to jump the call back into after
                   timeout.  Default &lt;priority+1&gt;.

The variable ${PARKEDAT} will contain the parking extension into which the
call was placed.  Use with the Local channel to allow the dialplan to make
use of this information.</screen></para>
