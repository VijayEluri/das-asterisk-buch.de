    <simpara>Requests transfer of the caller to the specified extension or
    device. If the technology is specified (<emphasis>e.g.</emphasis>
    <code>SIP</code>, <code>IAX2</code> etc.), only calls using the same
    technology will be transferred. In the case of SIP channels that have not
    yet been answered, this happens via a 302-<code>REDIRECT</code> message to
    the caller; if the call has already been answered, through a
    <code>REFER</code> message. The destination may also be a specific
    address, such as <code>8885551212@sip.provider.tld</code>.</simpara>

    <simpara>If option <code>j</code> is set, jumps to priority
    <replaceable>n</replaceable>+101 if the transfer fails.</simpara>

    <simpara>Sets the channel variable <code>TRANSFERSTATUS</code> to

    (meaning the channel driver does not support transfers).</simpara>

[Synopsis]
Transfer caller to remote extension

[Description]
  Transfer([Tech/]dest[|options]):  Requests the remote caller be transferred
to a given destination. If TECH (SIP, IAX2, LOCAL etc) is used, only
an incoming call with the same channel technology will be transfered.
Note that for SIP, if you transfer before call is setup, a 302 redirect
SIP message will be returned to the caller.

The result of the application will be reported in the TRANSFERSTATUS
channel variable:
       SUCCESS      Transfer succeeded
       FAILURE      Transfer failed
       UNSUPPORTED  Transfer unsupported by channel driver
The option string many contain the following character:
'j' -- jump to n+101 priority if the channel transfer attempt
       fails</screen></para>
