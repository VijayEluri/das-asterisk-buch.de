[Synopsis]
Record to a file

[Description]
  Record(filename.format|silence[|maxduration][|options])

Records from the channel into a given filename. If the file exists it will
be overwritten.
- &apos;format&apos; is the format of the file type to be recorded (wav, gsm, etc).
- &apos;silence&apos; is the number of seconds of silence to allow before returning.
- &apos;maxduration&apos; is the maximum recording duration in seconds. If missing
or 0 there is no maximum.
- &apos;options&apos; may contain any of the following letters:
     &apos;a&apos; : append to existing recording rather than replacing
     &apos;n&apos; : do not answer, but record anyway if line not yet answered
     &apos;q&apos; : quiet (do not play a beep tone)
     &apos;s&apos; : skip recording if the line is not yet answered
     &apos;t&apos; : use alternate &apos;*&apos; terminator key (DTMF) instead of default &apos;#&apos;
     &apos;x&apos; : ignore all terminator keys (DTMF) and keep recording until hangup

If filename contains &apos;%%%%d&apos;, these characters will be replaced with a number
incremented by one each time the file is recorded. A channel variable
named RECORDED_FILE will also be set, which contains the final filemname.

Use &apos;core show file formats&apos; to see the available formats on your system

User can press &apos;#&apos; to terminate the recording and continue to the next priority.

If the user should hangup during a recording, all data will be lost and the
application will teminate.</screen></para>
