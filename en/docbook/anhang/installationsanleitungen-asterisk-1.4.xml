  for Asterisk 1.4</title>

  <note>
    <para>The installation instructions in this appendix assume an
    installation on a freshly-installed operating system. If you deviate from
    this (e.g. using a server with a previously installed operating system
    that has been running for some time) you may encounter problems, depending
    on the specific circumstances. When troubleshooting any problems which
    arise, we recommend you proceed through the installation exactly as it is
    described here first.</para>

    <para>It is in the nature of a book and any rapidly changing software that
    the installation procedure will change from time to time. When in doubt,
    please check the on-line version at <citetitle><ulink
