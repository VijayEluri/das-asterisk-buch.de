    <simpara>Direct Inward System Access lets outside callers enter the system
    and provides them with an internal dial tone.</simpara>

    <synopsis>DISA(<replaceable>password</replaceable>[,<replaceable>context</replaceable>[,<replaceable>callerid</replaceable>[,<replaceable>mailbox</replaceable>[@<replaceable>voicemail-context</replaceable>]]]])</synopsis>

    <synopsis>DISA(<replaceable>password-file</replaceable>[,<replaceable>callerid</replaceable>[,<replaceable>mailbox</replaceable>[@<replaceable>voicemail-context</replaceable>]]])</synopsis>

    <simpara>Provides an internal dial tone to outside callers such that they
    can make calls as though calling from an internal extension. Upon hearing
    the dial tone, an access code must be entered followed by the "#" key. If
    it is correct, the caller hears another dial tone; this is the system dial
    tone and the caller can now dial and initiate calls.</simpara>

    <caution>
      <para>This type of access represents a serious and real security risk
      and should be planned and considered carefully before use, if it must be
      used at all!</para>
    </caution>

    <simpara>The <replaceable>password</replaceable> option is a numeric
    access code that must be entered in order for the caller to be able to
    make calls out. Following this particular syntax, all the users that call
    in will use the same access code. If you want to allow unsecured access,
    enter the string "<code>no-password</code>" instead of an actual
    password.</simpara>

    <simpara>The <replaceable>context</replaceable> option specifies the
    context in which the initiated call will be placed. If it is not provided,
    <code><command>DISA()</command></code> assumes the context named
    <code>disa</code>.</simpara>

    <simpara>The <emphasis>callerid</emphasis> option sets the mailbox number
    (and the optional <emphasis>voicemail-context</emphasis>) of a mailbox. If
    the mailbox contains new messages the caller will hear a stuttered dial
    tone to indicate this.</simpara>

    <simpara>Alternatively, you may use password-file to define multiple
    access passwords. Each line of this file can contain either an access code
    or a combination of an access code and a context, separated by the "|"
    (pipe) character. If no context is specified, <code>disa</code> is
    assumed.</simpara>

    <simpara>If the caller successfully authenticates with a valid access
    code, <command>DISA()</command> will start the call in the specified
    context.</simpara>

    <programlisting>; Allow outside callers to dial 800 numbers, provided they know the
; password (1234). Set the caller ID so that the call appears to be
; coming from inside the company:
[incoming]
exten =&gt; 123,1,DISA(1234,disa,Widgets Inc &lt;212-555-3412&gt;)
[disa]
exten =&gt; _0800XXXXXXXX,1,Dial(Zap/4/${EXTEN})</programlisting>
