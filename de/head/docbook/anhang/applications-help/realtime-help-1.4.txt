Realtime Data Lookup

[Description]
Use the RealTime config handler system to read data into channel variables.
RealTime(<family>|<colmatch>|<value>[|<prefix>])

All unique column names will be set as channel variables with optional prefix
to the name.  For example, a prefix of 'var_' would make the column 'name'
become the variable ${var_name}.  REALTIMECOUNT will be set with the number
of values read.
