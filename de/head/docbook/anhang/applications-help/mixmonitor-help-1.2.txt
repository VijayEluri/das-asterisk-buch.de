[Description]
  MixMonitor(<file>.<ext>[|<options>[|<command>]])

creates the file in the configured monitoring directory from
asterisk.conf.

Valid options:

 b      - Only save audio to the file while the channel is bridged.

 V(<x>) - Adjust the spoken volume by a factor of <x> (range -4 to 4)
 W(<x>) - Adjust the both heard and spoken volumes by a factor of <x>
         (range -4 to 4)

<command> will be executed when the recording is over
Any strings matching ^{X} will be unescaped to ${X} and
all variables will be evaluated at that time.
The variable MIXMONITOR_FILENAME will contain the filename used to record.
