[Synopsis]
Conditional goto

[Description]
  GotoIf(condition?[labeliftrue]:[labeliffalse]): This application will cause
the calling channel to jump to the specified location in the dialplan based on
the evaluation of the given condition. The channel will continue at
'labeliftrue' if the condition is true, or 'labeliffalse' if the condition is
false. The labels are specified with the same syntax as used within the Goto
application.  If the label chosen by the condition is omitted, no jump is
performed, but execution continues with the next priority in the dialplan.
