[Synopsis]
Conditional goto

[Description]
  GotoIf(condition?[labeliftrue]:[labeliffalse]): This application will set the current
context, extension, and priority in the channel structure based on the evaluation of
the given condition. After this application completes, the
pbx engine will continue dialplan execution at the specified location in the dialplan.
The channel will continue at
'labeliftrue' if the condition is true, or 'labeliffalse' if the condition is
false. The labels are specified with the same syntax as used within the Goto
application.  If the label chosen by the condition is omitted, no jump is
performed, and the execution passes to the next instruction.
If the target location is bogus, and does not exist, the execution engine will try
to find and execute the code in the 'i' (invalid)
extension in the current context. If that does not exist, it will try to execute the
'h' extension. If either or neither the 'h' or 'i' extensions have been defined, the
channel is hung up, and the execution of instructions on the channel is terminated.
Remember that this command can set the current context, and if the context specified
does not exist, then it will not be able to find any 'h' or 'i' extensions there, and
the channel and call will both be terminated!
