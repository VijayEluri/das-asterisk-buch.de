[Synopsis]
Listen to a channel, and optionally whisper into it

[Description]
  ExtenSpy(exten[@context][,options]): This application is used to listen to the
audio from an Asterisk channel. This includes the audio coming in and
out of the channel being spied on. Only channels created by outgoing calls for the
specified extension will be selected for spying. If the optional context is not
supplied, the current channel's context will be used.
  While spying, the following actions may be performed:
    - Dialing # cycles the volume level.
    - Dialing * will stop spying and look for another channel to spy on.
  Note: The X option superseeds the two features above in that if a valid
        single digit extension exists in the correct context it ChanSpy will
        exit to it.
  Options:
    b                      - Only spy on channels involved in a bridged call.
    B                      - Instead of whispering on a single channel barge in on both
                             channels involved in the call.
    d                      - Override the typical numeric DTMF functionality and instead
                             use DTMF to switch between spy modes.
                                     4 = spy mode
                                     5 = whisper mode
                                     6 = barge mode
    g(grp)                 - Only spy on channels in which one or more of the groups
                             listed in 'grp' matches one or more groups from the
                             SPYGROUP variable set on the channel to be spied upon.
                             Note that both 'grp' and SPYGROUP can contain either a
                             single group or a colon-delimited list of groups, such
                             as 'sales:support:accounting'.
    n([mailbox][@context]) - Say the name of the person being spied on if that person has recorded
                             his/her name. If a context is specified, then that voicemail context will
                             be searched when retrieving the name, otherwise the "default" context
                             will be searched. If no mailbox is specified, then the channel name will
                             be used when searching for the name (i.e. if SIP/1000 is the channel being
                             spied on and no mailbox is specified, then "1000" will be used when searching
                             for the name).
    q                      - Don't play a beep when beginning to spy on a channel, or speak the
                             selected channel name.
    r[(basename)]          - Record the session to the monitor spool directory. An
                             optional base for the filename may be specified. The
                             default is 'chanspy'.
    s                      - Skip the playback of the channel type (i.e. SIP, IAX, etc) when
                             speaking the selected channel name.
    v([value])             - Adjust the initial volume in the range from -4 to 4. A
                             negative value refers to a quieter setting.
    w                      - Enable 'whisper' mode, so the spying channel can talk to
                             the spied-on channel.
    W                      - Enable 'private whisper' mode, so the spying channel can
                             talk to the spied-on channel but cannot listen to that
                             channel.
    o                      - Only listen to audio coming from this channel.
    X                      - Allow the user to exit ChanSpy to a valid single digit
                             numeric extension in the current context or the context
                             specified by the SPY_EXIT_CONTEXT channel variable. The
                             name of the last channel that was spied on will be stored
                             in the SPY_CHANNEL variable.
