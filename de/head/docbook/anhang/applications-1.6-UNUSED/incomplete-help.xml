[Synopsis]
returns AST_PBX_INCOMPLETE value

[Description]
  Incomplete([n]): Signals the PBX routines that the previous matched extension
is incomplete and that further input should be allowed before matching can
be considered to be complete.  Can be used within a pattern match when
certain criteria warrants a longer match.
  If the &apos;n&apos; option is specified, then Incomplete will not attempt to answer
the channel first.  Note that most channel types need to be in Answer state
in order to receive DTMF.<screen>
