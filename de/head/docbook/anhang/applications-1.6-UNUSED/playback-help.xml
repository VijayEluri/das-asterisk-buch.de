Play a file

[Description]
  Playback(filename[&amp;filename2...][,option]):  Plays back given filenames (do not put
extension). Options may also be included following a comma.
The &apos;skip&apos; option causes the playback of the message to be skipped if the channel
is not in the &apos;up&apos; state (i.e. it hasn&apos;t been  answered  yet). If &apos;skip&apos; is
specified, the application will return immediately should the channel not be
off hook.  Otherwise, unless &apos;noanswer&apos; is specified, the channel will
be answered before the sound is played. Not all channels support playing
messages while still on hook.
This application sets the following channel variable upon completion:
 PLAYBACKSTATUS    The status of the playback attempt as a text string, one of
               SUCCESS | FAILED
See Also: Background (application) -- for playing soundfiles that are interruptible
          WaitExten (application) -- wait for digits from caller, optionally play music on hold<screen>
