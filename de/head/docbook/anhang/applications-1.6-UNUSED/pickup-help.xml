[Synopsis]
Directed Call Pickup

[Description]
  Pickup([extension[@context][&amp;extension2@[context]...]]):  This application can
pickup any ringing channel that is calling the specified extension.  If no
context is specified, the current context will be used. If you use the special
string &quot;PICKUPMARK&quot; for the context parameter, for example 10@PICKUPMARK,
this application tries to find a channel which has defined a ${PICKUPMARK}
channel variable with the same value as &quot;extension&quot; (in this example, &quot;10&quot;).
When no parameter is specified, the application will pickup a channel matching
the pickup group of the active channel.<screen>
