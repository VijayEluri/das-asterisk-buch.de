<   WaitForSilence(silencerequired[|iterations][|timeout]) 
< Wait for Silence: Waits for up to 'silencerequired' 
< milliseconds of silence, 'iterations' times or once if omitted.
< An optional timeout specified the number of seconds to return
< after, even if we do not receive the specified amount of silence.
< Use 'timeout' with caution, as it may defeat the purpose of this
< application, which is to wait indefinitely until silence is detected
< on the line.  This is particularly useful for reverse-911-type
< call broadcast applications where you need to wait for an answering
< machine to complete its spiel before playing a message.
< The timeout parameter is specified only to avoid an infinite loop in
< cases where silence is never achieved.  Typically you will want to
< include two or more calls to WaitForSilence when dealing with an answering
< machine; first waiting for the spiel to finish, then waiting for the beep, etc.

< Examples:
---
>   WaitForSilence(x[|y]) Wait for Silence: Waits for up to 'x' 
> milliseconds of silence, 'y' times or 1 if omitted
> Set the channel variable WAITSTATUS with to one of these values:SILENCE - if silence of x ms was detectedTIMEOUT - if silence of x ms was not detected.Examples:
26,31d12
<   - WaitForSilence(300|3|10) will wait for 300ms silence, 3 times,
<      and returns after 10 sec, even if silence is not detected
< 
< Sets the channel variable WAITSTATUS with to one of these values:
< SILENCE - if exited with silence detected
< TIMEOUT - if exited without silence detected after timeout
