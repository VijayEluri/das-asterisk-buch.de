Usage: core show channels [concise|verbose|count]
       Lists currently defined channels and some information about them. If
       'concise' is specified, the format is abridged and in a more easily
       machine parsable format. If 'verbose' is specified, the output includes
       more and longer fields. If 'count' is specified only the channel and call
       count is output.
        The 'concise' option is deprecated and will be removed from future versions
        of Asterisk.
