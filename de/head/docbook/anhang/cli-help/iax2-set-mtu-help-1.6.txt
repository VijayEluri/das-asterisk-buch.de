Usage: iax2 set mtu <value>
       Set the system-wide IAX IP mtu to <value> bytes net or
       zero to disable. Disabling means that the operating system
       must handle fragmentation of UDP packets when the IAX2 trunk
       packet exceeds the UDP payload size. This is substantially
       below the IP mtu. Try 1240 on ethernets. Must be 172 or
       greater for G.711 samples.
