[Synopsis]
Set channel variable(s) or function value(s)

[Description]
  MSet(name1=value1,name2=value2,...)
This function can be used to set the value of channel variables or dialplan
functions. When setting variables, if the variable name is prefixed with _,
the variable will be inherited into channels created from the current
channel. If the variable name is prefixed with __, the variable will be
inherited into channels created from the current channel and all children
channels.

MSet behaves in a similar fashion to the way Set worked in 1.2/1.4 and is thus
prone to doing things that you may not expect.  Avoid its use if possible.
