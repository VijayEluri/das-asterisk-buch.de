Play a file

[Description]
  Playback(filename[&filename2...][|option]):  Plays back given filenames (do not put
extension). Options may also be included following a pipe symbol. The 'skip'
option causes the playback of the message to be skipped if the channel
is not in the 'up' state (i.e. it hasn't been  answered  yet). If 'skip' is 
specified, the application will return immediately should the channel not be
off hook.  Otherwise, unless 'noanswer' is specified, the channel will
be answered before the sound is played. Not all channels support playing
messages while still on hook. If 'j' is specified, the application
will jump to priority n+101 if present when a file specified to be played
does not exist.
This application sets the following channel variable upon completion:
