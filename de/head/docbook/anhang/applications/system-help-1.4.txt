[Synopsis]
Execute a system command

[Description]
  System(command): Executes a command  by  using  system(). If the command
fails, the console should report a fallthrough. 
Result of execution is returned in the SYSTEMSTATUS channel variable:
   FAILURE  Could not execute the specified command
   SUCCESS  Specified command successfully executed

Old behaviour:
If the command itself executes but is in error, and if there exists
a priority n + 101, where 'n' is the priority of the current instance,
then  the  channel  will  be  setup to continue at that priority level.
Note that this jump functionality has been deprecated and will only occur
if the global priority jumping option is enabled in extensions.conf.
