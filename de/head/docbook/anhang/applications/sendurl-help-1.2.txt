[Synopsis]
Send a URL

[Description]
  SendURL(URL[|option]): Requests client go to URL (IAX2) or sends the 
URL to the client (other channels).
Result is returned in the SENDURLSTATUS channel variable:
    SUCCESS       URL successfully sent to client
    FAILURE       Failed to send URL
    NOLOAD        Clien failed to load URL (wait enabled)
    UNSUPPORTED   Channel does not support URL transport

If the option 'wait' is specified, execution will wait for an
acknowledgement that the URL has been loaded before continuing
and will return -1 if the peer is unable to load the URL

Old behaviour (deprecated): 
 If the client does not support Asterisk "html" transport, 
 and there exists a step with priority n + 101, then execution will
 continue at that step.
 Otherwise, execution will continue at the next priority level.
 SendURL only returns 0 if the URL was sent correctly  or if
 the channel does not support HTML transport, and -1 otherwise.
