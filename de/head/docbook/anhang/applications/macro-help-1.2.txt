Macro Implementation

[Description]
  Macro(macroname|arg1|arg2...): Executes a macro using the context
'macro-<macroname>', jumping to the 's' extension of that context and
executing each step, then returning when the steps end. 
The calling extension, context, and priority are stored in ${MACRO_EXTEN}, 
${MACRO_CONTEXT} and ${MACRO_PRIORITY} respectively.  Arguments become
${ARG1}, ${ARG2}, etc in the macro context.
If you Goto out of the Macro context, the Macro will terminate and control
will be returned at the location of the Goto.
If ${MACRO_OFFSET} is set at termination, Macro will attempt to continue
at priority MACRO_OFFSET + N + 1 if such a step exists, and N + 1 otherwise.
WARNING: Because of the way Macro is implemented (it executes the priorities
         contained within it via sub-engine), and a fixed per-thread
         memory stack allowance, macros are limited to 7 levels
         of nesting (macro calling macro calling macro, etc.); It
         may be possible that stack-intensive applications in deeply nested
         macros could cause asterisk to crash earlier than this limit.
