[Synopsis]
Send a URL

[Description]
  SendURL(URL[|option]): Requests client go to URL (IAX2) or sends the
URL to the client (other channels).
Result is returned in the SENDURLSTATUS channel variable:
    SUCCESS       URL successfully sent to client
    FAILURE       Failed to send URL
    NOLOAD        Client failed to load URL (wait enabled)
    UNSUPPORTED   Channel does not support URL transport

If the option &apos;wait&apos; is specified, execution will wait for an
acknowledgement that the URL has been loaded before continuing

If jumping is specified as an option (the &apos;j&apos; flag), the client does not
support Asterisk &quot;html&quot; transport, and there exists a step with priority
n + 101, then execution will continue at that step.

SendURL continues normally if the URL was sent correctly or if the channel
does not support HTML transport.  Otherwise, the channel is hung up.</screen></para>
