[Synopsis]
Listen to a channel, and optionally whisper into it

[Description]
  ChanSpy([chanprefix][|options]): This application is used to listen to the
audio from an Asterisk channel. This includes the audio coming in and
out of the channel being spied on. If the &apos;chanprefix&apos; parameter is specified,
only channels beginning with this string will be spied upon.
  While spying, the following actions may be performed:
    - Dialing # cycles the volume level.
    - Dialing * will stop spying and look for another channel to spy on.
    - Dialing a series of digits followed by # builds a channel name to append
      to &apos;chanprefix&apos;. For example, executing ChanSpy(Agent) and then dialing
      the digits &apos;1234#&apos; while spying will begin spying on the channel
      &apos;Agent/1234&apos;.
  Options:
    b             - Only spy on channels involved in a bridged call.
    g(grp)        - Match only channels where their ${SPYGROUP} variable is set to
                    contain &apos;grp&apos; in an optional : delimited list.
    q             - Don&apos;t play a beep when beginning to spy on a channel, or speak the
                    selected channel name.
    r[(basename)] - Record the session to the monitor spool directory. An
                    optional base for the filename may be specified. The
                    default is &apos;chanspy&apos;.
    v([value])    - Adjust the initial volume in the range from -4 to 4. A
                    negative value refers to a quieter setting.
    w             - Enable &apos;whisper&apos; mode, so the spying channel can talk to
                    the spied-on channel.
    W             - Enable &apos;private whisper&apos; mode, so the spying channel can
                    talk to the spied-on channel but cannot listen to that
                    channel.</screen></para>
