[Synopsis]
MeetMe conference bridge

[Description]
  MeetMe([confno][,[options][,pin]]): Enters the user into a specified MeetMe conference.
If the conference number is omitted, the user will be prompted to enter
one. 
User can exit the conference by hangup, or if the 'p' option is specified, by pressing '#'.
Please note: The Zaptel kernel modules and at least one hardware driver (or ztdummy)
             must be present for conferencing to operate properly. In addition, the chan_zap
             channel driver must be loaded for the 'i' and 'r' options to operate at all.

The option string may contain zero or more of the following characters:
      'a' -- set admin mode
      'A' -- set marked mode
      'b' -- run AGI script specified in ${MEETME_AGI_BACKGROUND}
             Default: conf-background.agi
             (Note: This does not work with non-Zap channels in the same conference)
      'c' -- announce user(s) count on joining a conference
      'd' -- dynamically add conference
      'D' -- dynamically add conference, prompting for a PIN
      'e' -- select an empty conference
      'E' -- select an empty pinless conference
      'i' -- announce user join/leave
      'm' -- set monitor only mode (Listen only, no talking)
      'M' -- enable music on hold when the conference has a single caller
      'p' -- allow user to exit the conference by pressing '#'
      'P' -- always prompt for the pin even if it is specified
      'q' -- quiet mode (don't play enter/leave sounds)
      'r' -- Record conference (records as ${MEETME_RECORDINGFILE}
             using format ${MEETME_RECORDINGFORMAT}). Default filename is
             meetme-conf-rec-${CONFNO}-${UNIQUEID} and the default format is wav.
      's' -- Present menu (user or admin) when '*' is received ('send' to menu)
      't' -- set talk only mode. (Talk only, no listening)
      'T' -- set talker detection (sent to manager interface and meetme list)
      'w[(<secs>)]'
          -- wait until the marked user enters the conference
      'x' -- close the conference when last marked user exits
      'X' -- allow user to exit the conference by entering a valid single
             digit extension ${MEETME_EXIT_CONTEXT} or the current context
             if that variable is not defined.
