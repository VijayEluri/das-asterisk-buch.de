[Synopsis]
Try executing a system command

[Description]
  TrySystem(command): Executes a command  by  using  system().
on any situation.
Result of execution is returned in the SYSTEMSTATUS channel variable:
   FAILURE        Could not execute the specified command
   SUCCESS        Specified command successfully executed
   APPERROR        Specified command successfully executed, but returned error code

Old behaviour:
If  the command itself executes but is in error, and if
there exists a priority n + 101, where 'n' is the priority of the current
instance, then  the  channel  will  be  setup  to continue at that
priority level.  Otherwise, System will terminate.
