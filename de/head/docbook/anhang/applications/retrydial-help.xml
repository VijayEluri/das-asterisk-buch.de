[Synopsis]
Place a call, retrying on failure allowing optional exit extension.

[Description]
  RetryDial(announce|sleep|retries|dialargs): This application will attempt to
place a call using the normal Dial application. If no channel can be reached,
the &apos;announce&apos; file will be played. Then, it will wait &apos;sleep&apos; number of
seconds before retrying the call. After &apos;retries&apos; number of attempts, the
calling channel will continue at the next priority in the dialplan. If the
&apos;retries&apos; setting is set to 0, this application will retry endlessly.
  While waiting to retry a call, a 1 digit extension may be dialed. If that
extension exists in either the context defined in ${EXITCONTEXT} or the current
one, The call will jump to that extension immediately.
  The &apos;dialargs&apos; are specified in the same format that arguments are provided
to the Dial application.</screen></para>
