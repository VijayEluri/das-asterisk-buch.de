Background a file with talk detect

[Description]
  BackgroundDetect(&lt;filename&gt;[,&lt;sil&gt;[,&lt;min&gt;[,&lt;max&gt;[,&lt;analysistime&gt;]]]]):
Plays back &lt;filename&gt;, waiting for interruption from a given digit (the digit
must start the beginning of a valid extension, or it will be ignored).  During
the playback of the file, audio is monitored in the receive direction, and if
a period of non-silence which is greater than &lt;min&gt; ms yet less than &lt;max&gt; ms
is followed by silence for at least &lt;sil&gt; ms, which occurs during the first
&lt;analysistime&gt; ms, then the audio playback is aborted and processing jumps to
the &lt;talk&gt; extension, if available.  If unspecified, &lt;sil&gt;, &lt;min&gt;, &lt;max&gt;, and
&lt;analysistime&gt; default to 1000, 100, infinity, and infinity respectively.<screen>
