[Synopsis]
Background a file with talk detect

[Description]
  BackgroundDetect(<filename>[,<sil>[,<min>[,<max>[,<analysistime>]]]]):
Plays back <filename>, waiting for interruption from a given digit (the digit
must start the beginning of a valid extension, or it will be ignored).  During
the playback of the file, audio is monitored in the receive direction, and if
a period of non-silence which is greater than <min> ms yet less than <max> ms
is followed by silence for at least <sil> ms, which occurs during the first
<analysistime> ms, then the audio playback is aborted and processing jumps to
the <talk> extension, if available.  If unspecified, <sil>, <min>, <max>, and
<analysistime> default to 1000, 100, infinity, and infinity respectively.
