Provide support for receiving alarm reports from a burglar or fire alarm panel

[Description]
  AlarmReceiver(): Only 1 signalling format is supported at this time: Ademco
Contact ID. This application should be called whenever there is an alarm
panel calling in to dump its events. The application will handshake with the
alarm panel, and receive events, validate them, handshake them, and store them
until the panel hangs up. Once the panel hangs up, the application will run the
system command specified by the eventcmd setting in alarmreceiver.conf and pipe
the events to the standard input of the application. The configuration file also
contains settings for DTMF timing, and for the loudness of the acknowledgement
tones.
