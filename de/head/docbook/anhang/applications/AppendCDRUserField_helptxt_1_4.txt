[Description]
AppendCDRUserField(value): Append value to the CDR user field
       The Call Data Record (CDR) user field is an extra field you
       can use for data not stored anywhere else in the record.
       CDR records can be used for billing or storing other arbitrary data
       (I.E. telephone survey responses)
       Also see SetCDRUserField().
