[Synopsis]
Executes AGI on a hungup channel

[Description]
  [E|Dead]AGI(command|args): Executes an Asterisk Gateway Interface compliant
program on a channel. AGI allows Asterisk to launch external programs
written in any language to control a telephony channel, play audio,
read DTMF digits, etc. by communicating with the AGI protocol on stdin
and stdout.
  This channel will stop dialplan execution on hangup inside of this
application, except when using DeadAGI.  Otherwise, dialplan execution
will continue normally.
  A locally executed AGI script will receive SIGHUP on hangup from the channel
except when using DeadAGI. This can be disabled by setting the AGISIGHUP channel
variable to "no" before executing the AGI application.
  Using 'EAGI' provides enhanced AGI, with incoming audio available out of band
on file descriptor 3

  Use the CLI command 'agi show' to list available agi commands
  This application sets the following channel variable upon completion:
     AGISTATUS      The status of the attempt to the run the AGI script
                    text string, one of SUCCESS | FAILED | HANGUP
