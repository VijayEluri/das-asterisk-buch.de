[Synopsis]
Set channel variable(s) or function value(s)

[Description]
  Set(name1=value1|name2=value2|..[|options])
This function can be used to set the value of channel variables or dialplan
functions. It will accept up to 24 name/value pairs. When setting variables,
if the variable name is prefixed with _, the variable will be inherited into
channels created from the current channel. If the variable name is prefixed
with __, the variable will be inherited into channels created from the current
channel and all children channels.
  Options:
    g - Set variable globally instead of on the channel
        (applies only to variables, not functions)


The use of Set to set multiple variables at once and the g flag have both
been deprecated.  Please use multiple Set calls and the GLOBAL() dialplan
function instead.
