[Synopsis]
Record to a file

[Description]
  Record(filename.format|silence[|maxduration][|options])

Records from the channel into a given filename. If the file exists it will
be overwritten.
- 'format' is the format of the file type to be recorded (wav, gsm, etc).
- 'silence' is the number of seconds of silence to allow before returning.
- 'maxduration' is the maximum recording duration in seconds. If missing
or 0 there is no maximum.
- 'options' may contain any of the following letters:
     'a' : append to existing recording rather than replacing
     'n' : do not answer, but record anyway if line not yet answered
     'q' : quiet (do not play a beep tone)
     's' : skip recording if the line is not yet answered
     't' : use alternate '*' terminator key instead of default '#'

If filename contains '%d', these characters will be replaced with a number
incremented by one each time the file is recorded. 

Use 'show file formats' to see the available formats on your system

User can press '#' to terminate the recording and continue to the next priority.

If the user should hangup during a recording, all data will be lost and the
application will teminate.
