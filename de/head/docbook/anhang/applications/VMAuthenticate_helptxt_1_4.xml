Authenticate with Voicemail passwords

[Description]
  VMAuthenticate([mailbox][@context][|options]): This application behaves the
same way as the Authenticate application, but the passwords are taken from
voicemail.conf.
  If the mailbox is specified, only that mailbox's password will be considered
valid. If the mailbox is not specified, the channel variable AUTH_MAILBOX will
be set with the authenticated mailbox.
