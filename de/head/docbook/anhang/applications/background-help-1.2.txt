[Synopsis]
Play a file while awaiting extension

[Description]
  Background(filename1[&filename2...][|options[|langoverride][|context]]):
This application will play the given list of files while waiting for an
extension to be dialed by the calling channel. To continue waiting for digits
after this application has finished playing files, the WaitExten application
should be used. The 'langoverride' option explicity specifies which language
to attempt to use for the requested sound files. If a 'context' is specified,
this is the dialplan context that this application will use when exiting to a
dialed extension.  If one of the requested sound files does not exist, call processing will be
terminated.
  Options:
    s - causes the playback of the message to be skipped
          if the channel is not in the 'up' state (i.e. it
          hasn't been answered yet.) If this happens, the
          application will return immediately.
    n - don't answer the channel before playing the files
    m - only break if a digit hit matches a one digit
          extension in the destination context
