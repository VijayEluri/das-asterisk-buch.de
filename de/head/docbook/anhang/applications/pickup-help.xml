that is calling the specified extension. If no context is specified, the current
context will be used. If you use the special string &quot;PICKUPMARK&quot; for the context parameter, for example
10@PICKUPMARK, this application tries to find a channel which has defined a channel variable with the same content
as &quot;extension&quot;.</screen></para>
