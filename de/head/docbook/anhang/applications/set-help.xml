[Synopsis]
Set channel variable(s) or function value(s)

[Description]
  Set(name1=value1|name2=value2|..[|options])
This function can be used to set the value of channel variables or dialplan
functions. It will accept up to 24 name/value pairs. When setting variables,
if the variable name is prefixed with _, the variable will be inherited into
channels created from the current channel. If the variable name is prefixed
with __, the variable will be inherited into channels created from the current
channel and all children channels.
  Options:
    g - Set variable globally instead of on the channel
        (applies only to variables, not functions)


The use of Set to set multiple variables at once and the g flag have both
been deprecated.  Please use multiple Set calls and the GLOBAL() dialplan
function instead.</screen></para>

+  Compatibility note: If (and only if), in /etc/asterisk/asterisk.conf, you have a [compat]
+  category, and you have app_set = 1.6 under that, then the behavior of this
+  app changes, and does not strip surrounding quotes from the right hand side
+  as it did previously in 1.4. The app_set = 1.6 is only inserted if &apos;make samples&apos;
+  is executed, or if users insert this by hand into the asterisk.conf file.
+  /nThe advantages of not stripping out quoting, and not caring about the
+  separator characters (comma and vertical bar) were sufficient to make these
+  changes in 1.6. Confusion about how many backslashes would be needed to properly
+  protect separators and quotes in various database access strings has been greatly
+  reduced by these changes.</screen></para>
