[Synopsis]
Queue a call for a call queue

[Description]
  Queue(queuename[|options[|URL][|announceoverride][|timeout]]):
Queues an incoming call in a particular call queue as defined in queues.conf.
This application will return to the dialplan if the queue does not exist, or
any of the join options cause the caller to not enter the queue.
The option string may contain zero or more of the following characters:
      'd' -- data-quality (modem) call (minimum delay).
      'h' -- allow callee to hang up by hitting *.
      'H' -- allow caller to hang up by hitting *.
      'n' -- no retries on the timeout; will exit this application and
       go to the next step.
      'r' -- ring instead of playing MOH
      't' -- allow the called user transfer the calling user
      'T' -- to allow the calling user to transfer the call.
      'w' -- allow the called user to write the conversation to disk via Monitor
      'W' -- allow the calling user to write the conversation to disk via Monitor
  In addition to transferring the call, a call may be parked and then picked
up by another user.
  The optional URL will be sent to the called party if the channel supports
it.
  The timeout will cause the queue to fail out after a specified number of
seconds, checked between each queues.conf 'timeout' and 'retry' cycle.
  This application sets the following channel variable upon completion:
      QUEUESTATUS    The status of the call as a text string, one of
             TIMEOUT | FULL | JOINEMPTY | LEAVEEMPTY | JOINUNAVAIL | LEAVEUNAVAIL
