[Syntax]
CDR(&lt;name&gt;[,options])

[Synopsis]
Gets or sets a CDR variable

[Description]
Options:
  &apos;l&apos; uses the most recent CDR on a channel with multiple records
  &apos;r&apos; searches the entire stack of CDRs on the channel
  &apos;s&apos; skips any CDR&apos;s that are marked &apos;LOCKED&apos; due to forkCDR() calls.
      (on setting/writing CDR vars only)
  &apos;u&apos; retrieves the raw, unprocessed value
  For example, &apos;start&apos;, &apos;answer&apos;, and &apos;end&apos; will be retrieved as epoch
  values, when the &apos;u&apos; option is passed, but formatted as YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
  otherwise.  Similarly, disposition and amaflags will return their raw
  integral values.
  Here is a list of all the available cdr field names:
    clid          lastdata       disposition
    src           start          amaflags
    dst           answer         accountcode
    dcontext      end            uniqueid
    dstchannel    duration       userfield
    lastapp       billsec        channel
  All of the above variables are read-only, except for accountcode,
  userfield, and amaflags. You may, however,  supply
  a name not on the above list, and create your own
  variable, whose value can be changed with this function,
  and this variable will be stored on the cdr.
  For setting CDR values, the &apos;l&apos; flag does not apply to
  setting the accountcode, userfield, or amaflags.
   raw values for disposition:
       1 = NO ANSWER
       2 = BUSY
       3 = FAILED
       4 = ANSWERED
    raw values for amaflags:
       1 = OMIT
       2 = BILLING
       3 = DOCUMENTATION<screen>
