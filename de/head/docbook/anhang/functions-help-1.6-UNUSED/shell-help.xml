[Syntax]
SHELL(&lt;command&gt;)

[Synopsis]
Executes a command as if you were at a shell.

[Description]
Returns the value from a system command
  Example:  Set(foo=${SHELL(echo &quot;bar&quot;)})
  Note:  When using the SHELL() dialplan function, your &quot;SHELL&quot; is /bin/sh,
  which may differ as to the underlying shell, depending upon your production
  platform.  Also keep in mind that if you are using a common path, you should
  be mindful of race conditions that could result from two calls running
  SHELL() simultaneously.<screen>
