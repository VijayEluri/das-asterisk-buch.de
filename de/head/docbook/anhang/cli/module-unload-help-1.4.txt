Usage: module unload [-f|-h] <module name>
       Unloads the specified module from Asterisk. The -f
       option causes the module to be unloaded even if it is
       in use (may cause a crash) and the -h module causes the
       module to be unloaded even if the module says it cannot,
       which almost always will cause a crash.
