-= Info about function 'LOCK' =-

[Syntax]
LOCK(<lockname>)

[Synopsis]
Attempt to obtain a named mutex

[Description]
Attempts to grab a named lock exclusively, and prevents other channels from
obtaining the same lock.  LOCK will wait for the lock to become available.
Returns 1 if the lock was obtained or 0 on error.

Note: to avoid the possibility of a deadlock, LOCK will only attempt to
obtain the lock for 3 seconds if the channel already has another lock.
