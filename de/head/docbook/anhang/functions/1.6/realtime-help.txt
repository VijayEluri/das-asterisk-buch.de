RealTime Read/Write Functions

[Description]
This function will read or write values from/to a RealTime repository.
REALTIME(....) will read names/values from the repository, and
REALTIME(....)= will write a new value/field to the repository. On a
read, this function returns a delimited text string. The name/value
pairs are delimited by delim1, and the name and value are delimited
between each other with delim2. The default for delim1 is ',' and
the default for delim2 is '='. If there is no match, NULL will be
returned by the function. On a write, this function will always
return NULL.
