-= Info about function 'EVAL' =-

[Syntax]
EVAL(<variable>)

[Synopsis]
Evaluate stored variables.

[Description]
Using EVAL basically causes a string to be evaluated twice.
When a variable or expression is in the dialplan, it will be
evaluated at runtime. However, if the result of the evaluation
is in fact a variable or expression, using EVAL will have it
evaluated a second time. For example, if the variable ${MYVAR}
contains "${OTHERVAR}", then the result of putting ${EVAL(${MYVAR})}
in the dialplan will be the contents of the variable, OTHERVAR.
Normally, by just putting ${MYVAR} in the dialplan, you would be
left with "${OTHERVAR}".
