  -= Info about function 'SHELL' =-

[Syntax]
SHELL(<command>)

[Synopsis]
Executes a command as if you were at a shell.

[Description]
Returns the value from a system command
  Example:  Set(foo=${SHELL(echo "bar")})
  Note:  When using the SHELL() dialplan function, your "SHELL" is /bin/sh,
  which may differ as to the underlying shell, depending upon your production
  platform.  Also keep in mind that if you are using a common path, you should
  be mindful of race conditions that could result from two calls running
  SHELL() simultaneously.
