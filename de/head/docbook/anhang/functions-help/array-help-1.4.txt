  -= Info about function 'ARRAY' =-

[Syntax]
ARRAY(var1[|var2[...][|varN]])

[Synopsis]
Allows setting multiple variables at once

[Description]
The comma-separated list passed as a value to which the function is set will
be interpreted as a set of values to which the comma-separated list of
variable names in the argument should be set.
Hence, Set(ARRAY(var1|var2)=1\,2) will set var1 to 1 and var2 to 2
Note: remember to either backslash your commas in extensions.conf or quote the
entire argument, since Set can take multiple arguments itself.
