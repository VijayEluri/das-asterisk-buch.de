  -= Info about function 'SMDI_MSG_RETRIEVE' =-

[Syntax]
SMDI_MSG_RETRIEVE(<smdi port>,<search key>[,timeout[,options]])

[Synopsis]
Retrieve an SMDI message.

[Description]
   This function is used to retrieve an incoming SMDI message.  It returns
an ID which can be used with the SMDI_MSG() function to access details of
the message.  Note that this is a destructive function in the sense that
once an SMDI message is retrieved using this function, it is no longer in
the global SMDI message queue, and can not be accessed by any other Asterisk
channels.  The timeout for this function is optional, and the default is
3 seconds.  When providing a timeout, it should be in milliseconds.
   The default search is done on the forwarding station ID.  However, if
you set one of the search key options in the options field, you can change
this behavior.
   Options:
     t - Instead of searching on the forwarding station, search on the message
         desk terminal.
     n - Instead of searching on the forwarding station, search on the message
         desk number.
