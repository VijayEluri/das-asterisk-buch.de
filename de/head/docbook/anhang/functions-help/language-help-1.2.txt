[Syntax]
LANGUAGE()

[Synopsis]
Gets or sets the channel's language.

[Description]
Gets or sets the channel language.  This information is used for the
syntax in generation of numbers, and to choose a natural language file
when available.  For example, if language is set to 'fr' and the file
'demo-congrats' is requested to be played, if the file
'fr/demo-congrats' exists, then it will play that file, and if not
will play the normal 'demo-congrats'.  For some language codes,
changing the language also changes the syntax of some Asterisk
functions, like SayNumber.
