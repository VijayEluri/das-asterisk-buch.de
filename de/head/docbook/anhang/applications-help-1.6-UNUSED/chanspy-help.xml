[Synopsis]
Listen to a channel, and optionally whisper into it

[Description]
  ChanSpy([chanprefix][,options]): This application is used to listen to the
audio from an Asterisk channel. This includes the audio coming in and
out of the channel being spied on. If the &apos;chanprefix&apos; parameter is specified,
only channels beginning with this string will be spied upon.
  While spying, the following actions may be performed:
    - Dialing # cycles the volume level.
    - Dialing * will stop spying and look for another channel to spy on.
    - Dialing a series of digits followed by # builds a channel name to append
      to &apos;chanprefix&apos;. For example, executing ChanSpy(Agent) and then dialing
      the digits &apos;1234#&apos; while spying will begin spying on the channel
      &apos;Agent/1234&apos;. Note that this feature will be overriden if the &apos;d&apos; option
       is used
  Note: The X option supersedes the three features above in that if a valid
        single digit extension exists in the correct context ChanSpy will
        exit to it. This also disables choosing a channel based on &apos;chanprefix&apos;
        and a digit sequence.
  Options:
    b                      - Only spy on channels involved in a bridged call.
    B                      - Instead of whispering on a single channel barge in on both
                             channels involved in the call.
    d                      - Override the typical numeric DTMF functionality and instead
                             use DTMF to switch between spy modes.
                                     4 = spy mode
                                     5 = whisper mode
                                     6 = barge mode
    g(grp)                 - Only spy on channels in which one or more of the groups
                             listed in &apos;grp&apos; matches one or more groups from the
                             SPYGROUP variable set on the channel to be spied upon.
                             Note that both &apos;grp&apos; and SPYGROUP can contain either a
                             single group or a colon-delimited list of groups, such
                             as &apos;sales:support:accounting&apos;.
    n([mailbox][@context]) - Say the name of the person being spied on if that person has recorded
                             his/her name. If a context is specified, then that voicemail context will
                             be searched when retrieving the name, otherwise the &quot;default&quot; context
                             will be searched. If no mailbox is specified, then the channel name will
                             be used when searching for the name (i.e. if SIP/1000 is the channel being
                             spied on and no mailbox is specified, then &quot;1000&quot; will be used when searching
                             for the name).
    q                      - Don&apos;t play a beep when beginning to spy on a channel, or speak the
                             selected channel name.
    r[(basename)]          - Record the session to the monitor spool directory. An
                             optional base for the filename may be specified. The
                             default is &apos;chanspy&apos;.
    s                      - Skip the playback of the channel type (i.e. SIP, IAX, etc) when
                             speaking the selected channel name.
    v([value])             - Adjust the initial volume in the range from -4 to 4. A
                             negative value refers to a quieter setting.
    w                      - Enable &apos;whisper&apos; mode, so the spying channel can talk to
                             the spied-on channel.
    W                      - Enable &apos;private whisper&apos; mode, so the spying channel can
                             talk to the spied-on channel but cannot listen to that
                             channel.
    o                      - Only listen to audio coming from this channel.
    X                      - Allow the user to exit ChanSpy to a valid single digit
                             numeric extension in the current context or the context
                             specified by the SPY_EXIT_CONTEXT channel variable. The
                             name of the last channel that was spied on will be stored
                             in the SPY_CHANNEL variable.
    e(ext)                 - Enable &apos;enforced&apos; mode, so the spying channel can
                             only monitor extensions whose name is in the &apos;ext&apos; :
                             delimited list.<screen>
