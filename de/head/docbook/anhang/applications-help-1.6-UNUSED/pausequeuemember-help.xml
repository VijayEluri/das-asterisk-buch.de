[Synopsis]
Pauses a queue member

[Description]
   PauseQueueMember([queuename],interface[,options[,reason]]):
Pauses (blocks calls for) a queue member.
The given interface will be paused in the given queue.  This prevents
any calls from being sent from the queue to the interface until it is
unpaused with UnpauseQueueMember or the manager interface.  If no
queuename is given, the interface is paused in every queue it is a
member of. The application will fail if the interface is not found.
The reason string is entirely optional and is used to add extra information
to the appropriate queue_log entries and manager events.
  This application sets the following channel variable upon completion:
     PQMSTATUS      The status of the attempt to pause a queue member as a
                     text string, one of
           PAUSED | NOTFOUND
Example: PauseQueueMember(,SIP/3000)<screen>
