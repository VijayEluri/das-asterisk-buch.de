[Synopsis]
Shared Line Appearance Station

[Description]
  SLAStation(<station name>):
This application should be executed by an SLA station.  The argument depends
on how the call was initiated.  If the phone was just taken off hook, then
the argument "station" should be just the station name.  If the call was
initiated by pressing a line key, then the station name should be preceded
by an underscore and the trunk name associated with that line button.
For example: "station1_line1".  On exit, this application will set the variable SLASTATION_STATUS to
one of the following values:
    FAILURE | CONGESTION | SUCCESS
