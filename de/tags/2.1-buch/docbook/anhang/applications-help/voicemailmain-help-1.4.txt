Check Voicemail messages

[Description]
  VoiceMailMain([mailbox][@context][|options]): This application allows the
calling party to check voicemail messages. A specific mailbox, and optional
corresponding context, may be specified. If a mailbox is not provided, the
calling party will be prompted to enter one. If a context is not specified,
the 'default' context will be used.

  Options:

           is entered by the caller.

           message. The units are whole-number decibels (dB).
    s    - Skip checking the passcode for the mailbox.
    a(#) - Skip folder prompt and go directly to folder specified.
           Defaults to INBOX
