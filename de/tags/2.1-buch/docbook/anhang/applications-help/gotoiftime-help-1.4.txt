[Synopsis]
Conditional Goto based on the current time

[Description]
  GotoIfTime(<times>|<weekdays>|<mdays>|<months>?[[context|]exten|]priority):
This application will set the context, extension, and priority in the channel structure
if the current time matches the given time specification. Otherwise, nothing is done.
Further information on the time specification can be found in examples
illustrating how to do time-based context includes in the dialplan.
If the target jump location is bogus, the same actions would be taken as for Goto.
