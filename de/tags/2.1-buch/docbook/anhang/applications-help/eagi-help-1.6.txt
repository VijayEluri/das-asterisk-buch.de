[Synopsis]
Executes an EAGI compliant application

[Description]
  [E|Dead]AGI(command,args): Executes an Asterisk Gateway Interface compliant
program on a channel. AGI allows Asterisk to launch external programs written
in any language to control a telephony channel, play audio, read DTMF digits,
etc. by communicating with the AGI protocol on stdin and stdout.
  As of 1.6.0, this channel will not stop dialplan execution on hangup inside
of this application. Dialplan execution will continue normally, even upon
hangup until the AGI application signals a desire to stop (either by exiting
or, in the case of a net script, by closing the connection).
  A locally executed AGI script will receive SIGHUP on hangup from the channel
except when using DeadAGI. A fast AGI server will correspondingly receive a
HANGUP in OOB data. Both of these signals may be disabled by setting the
AGISIGHUP channel variable to "no" before executing the AGI application.
  Using 'EAGI' provides enhanced AGI, with incoming audio available out of band
on file descriptor 3.

  Use the CLI command 'agi show' to list available agi commands.
  This application sets the following channel variable upon completion:
     AGISTATUS      The status of the attempt to the run the AGI script
                    text string, one of SUCCESS | FAILURE | NOTFOUND | HANGUP
