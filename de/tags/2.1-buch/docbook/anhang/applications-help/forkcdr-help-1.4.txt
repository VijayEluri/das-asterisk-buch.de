Forks the Call Data Record

[Description]
  ForkCDR([options]):  Causes the Call Data Record to fork an additional
cdr record starting from the time of the fork call
  Options:
    a  - update the answer time on the NEW CDR just after it's been inited..
         The new CDR may have been answered already, the reset that forkcdr.
         does will erase the answer time. This will bring it back, but.
         the answer time will be a copy of the fork/start time. It will.
         only do this if the initial cdr was indeed already answered..
    D -  Copy the disposition forward from the old cdr, after the .
         init..
    d -  Clear the dstchannel on the new CDR after reset..
    e -  end the original CDR. Do this after all the necc. data.
         is copied from the original CDR to the new forked CDR..
    R -  do NOT reset the new cdr..
    s(name=val) - Set the CDR var 'name' in the original CDR, with value.
                  'val'.
    v  - When the new CDR is forked, it gets a copy of the vars attached
         to the current CDR. The vars attached to the original CDR are removed
         unless this option is specified.
