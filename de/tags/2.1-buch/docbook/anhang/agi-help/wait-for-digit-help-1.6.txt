 Usage: WAIT FOR DIGIT <timeout>
        Waits up to 'timeout' milliseconds for channel to receive a DTMF digit.
 Returns -1 on channel failure, 0 if no digit is received in the timeout, or
 the numerical value of the ascii of the digit if one is received.  Use -1
 for the timeout value if you desire the call to block indefinitely.
