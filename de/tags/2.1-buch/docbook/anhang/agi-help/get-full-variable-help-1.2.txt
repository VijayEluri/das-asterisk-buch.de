 Usage: GET FULL VARIABLE <variablename> [<channel name>]
        Returns 0 if <variablename> is not set or channel does not exist.  Returns 1
if <variablename>  is set and returns the variable in parenthesis.  Understands
complex variable names and builtin variables, unlike GET VARIABLE.
 example return code: 200 result=1 (testvariable)
