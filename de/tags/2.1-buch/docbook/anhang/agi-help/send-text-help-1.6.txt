 Usage: SEND TEXT "<text to send>"
        Sends the given text on a channel. Most channels do not support the
 transmission of text.  Returns 0 if text is sent, or if the channel does not
 support text transmission.  Returns -1 only on error/hangup.  Text
 consisting of greater than one word should be placed in quotes since the
 command only accepts a single argument.
