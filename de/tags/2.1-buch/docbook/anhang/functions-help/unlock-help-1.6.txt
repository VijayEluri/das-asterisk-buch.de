  -= Info about function 'UNLOCK' =-

[Syntax]
UNLOCK(<lockname>)

[Synopsis]
Unlocks a named mutex

[Description]
Unlocks a previously locked mutex.  Note that it is generally unnecessary to
unlock in a hangup routine, as any locks held are automatically freed when the
channel is destroyed.  Returns 1 if the channel had a lock or 0 otherwise.
