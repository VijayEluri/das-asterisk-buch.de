Usage: iax set jitter [callid] <value>
       If used with a callid, it sets the jitter buffer to the given static
value (until its next calculation).  If used without a callid, the value is used
to establish the maximum excess jitter buffer that is permitted before the jitter
buffer size is reduced.
