 Usage: STREAM FILE <filename> <escape digits> [sample offset]
        Send the given file, allowing playback to be interrupted by the given
 digits, if any. Use double quotes for the digits if you wish none to be
 permitted. If sample offset is provided then the audio will seek to sample
 offset before play starts.  Returns 0 if playback completes without a digit
 being pressed, or the ASCII numerical value of the digit if one was pressed,
 or -1 on error or if the channel was disconnected. Remember, the file
 extension must not be included in the filename.
