[Synopsis]
Apply automatic gain control to audio on a channel

[Description]
  The AGC function will apply automatic gain control to audio on the channel
that this function is executed on.  Use rx for audio received from the channel
and tx to apply AGC to the audio being sent to the channel.  When using this
function, you set a target audio level.  It is primarily intended for use with
analog lines, but could be useful for other channels, as well.  The target volume
is set with a number between 1 and 32768.  Larger numbers are louder.
  Example Usage:
    Set(AGC(rx)=8000)
    Set(AGC(tx)=8000)
    Set(AGC(rx)=off)
    Set(AGC(tx)=off)
