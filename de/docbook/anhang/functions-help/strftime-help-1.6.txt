  -= Info about function 'STRFTIME' =-

[Syntax]
STRFTIME([<epoch>][,[timezone][,format]])

[Synopsis]
Returns the current date/time in a specified format.

[Description]
STRFTIME sports all of the same formats as the underlying C function
strftime(3) - see the man page for details.  It also supports the
following format:
 %[n]q - fractions of a second, with leading zeroes.  For example, %3q will
         give milliseconds and %1q will give tenths of a second.  The default
         is to output milliseconds (n=3).  The common case is to use it in
         combination with %S, as in "%S.%3q".
