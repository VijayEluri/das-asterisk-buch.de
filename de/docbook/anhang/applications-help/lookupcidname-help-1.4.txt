[Synopsis]
Look up CallerID Name from local database

[Description]
  LookupCIDName: Looks up the Caller*ID number on the active
channel in the Asterisk database (family 'cidname') and sets the
Caller*ID name.  Does nothing if no Caller*ID was received on the
channel.  This is useful if you do not subscribe to Caller*ID
name delivery, or if you want to change the names on some incoming
calls.

LookupCIDName is deprecated.  Please use ${DB(cidname/${CALLERID(num)})}
instead.
