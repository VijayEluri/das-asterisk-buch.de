[Synopsis]
Check the channel count of a group against a limit

[Description]
Usage: CheckGroup(max[@category][|options])
  Checks that the current number of total channels in the
current channel's group does not exceed 'max'.  If the number
does not exceed 'max', we continue to the next step.
 The option string may contain zero of the following character:
        'j' -- jump to n+101 priority if the number does in fact exceed max,
              and priority n+101 exists. Execuation then continues at that
               step, otherwise -1 is returned.
 This application sets the following channel variable upon successful completion:
        CHECKGROUPSTATUS  The status of the check that the current channel's
                          group does not exceed 'max'. It's value is one of
                OK | OVERMAX
