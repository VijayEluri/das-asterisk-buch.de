[Synopsis]
Interfaces with an external IVR application

[Description]
  ExternalIVR(command|ivr://ivrhosti([,arg[,arg...]])[,options]): Either forks a process
to run given command or makes a socket to connect to given host and starts
a generator on the channel. The generator's play list is controlled by the
external application, which can add and clear entries via simple commands
issued over its stdout. The external application will receive all DTMF events
received on the channel, and notification if the channel is hung up. The
application will not be forcibly terminated when the channel is hung up.
See doc/externalivr.txt for a protocol specification.
The 'n' option tells ExternalIVR() not to answer the channel.
The 'i' option tells ExternalIVR() not to send a hangup and exit when the
  channel receives a hangup, instead it sends an 'I' informative message
  meaning that the external application MUST hang up the call with an H command
The 'd' option tells ExternalIVR() to run on a channel that has been hung up
  and will not look for hangups.  The external application must exit with
  an 'E' command.
