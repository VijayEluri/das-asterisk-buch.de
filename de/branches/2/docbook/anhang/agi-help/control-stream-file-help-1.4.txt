 Usage: CONTROL STREAM FILE <filename> <escape digits> [skipms] [ffchar] [rewchr] [pausechr]
        Send the given file, allowing playback to be controled by the given
 digits, if any. Use double quotes for the digits if you wish none to be
 permitted.  Returns 0 if playback completes without a digit
 being pressed, or the ASCII numerical value of the digit if one was pressed,
 or -1 on error or if the channel was disconnected. Remember, the file
 extension must not be included in the filename.

 Note: ffchar and rewchar default to * and # respectively.
